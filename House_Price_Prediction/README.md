## 🧠 What I Did

1. Loaded and explored real-world housing data.
2. Created new ratio-based features:
   - Rooms per Household
   - Bedrooms per Room
   - Population per Household
3. Applied Ridge Regression to reduce overfitting.
4. Evaluated performance using R² and RMSE.
5. Built an interactive web app using Streamlit.
6. Deployed the application online.
